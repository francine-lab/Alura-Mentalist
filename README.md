# Mentalist Project

The job was to create a guessing game, where the program chooses a random number, and the user could try to get it right.

## Tasks performed to achieve this project

- The users are able to:
    - Make three attempts to guess a number between 0 and 10
    - See the positive or negative result of their answer on the screen

## Extra task

- I implemented a randomly generated method for the numbers to be guessed in this game.  For each new game, this number is randomly modified. The user can play as many times as he wishes and can observe the number of games played on the screen, and he also can identify the number of times he has won the game! : D
